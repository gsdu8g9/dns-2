# Changelog

### v0.3.0

- Changes
    - The following methods now return a `Generator` that can be used to create a `Coroutine` instead of returning a promise. Wrap the function call with `new Coroutine()` to create a promise or use with `yield` in a coroutine. This change was made to support `yield from` in PHP 7.
